You can use this aplication [here!](https://spardaprime.github.io/Calendar-prod/)
In this project I used:
* JavaScript ( es6 , localStorage )
* Sass
* Eslint
* Webpack

All components are in the SRC folder.
You can run this project locally just do:
* Clone branch review with git clone 
* Go to created folder
* `npm install`
* `npx webpack` or `npm webpack`
* `cd dist`
* `index.html`
